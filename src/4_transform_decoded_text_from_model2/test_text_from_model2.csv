AimeeMullins_1998.stm,. but in the previous instances of those the sars century in our language isnt allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want. now the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable. our language hasnt caught up with the changes in our society many of which you write about their technology certainly for medical standpoint. my legs arm in arm laser surgery for a vision impairment i take a knee and knees and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature is imposed on them. not to mention social networking platforms allows people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing. the perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what hes always been a truth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society. and that the human ability to adapt as our greatest asset in human ability to adapt an interesting thing because people. have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity. and im an in making admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt an easy trying to you answer peoples questions about it and i think im starting to figure out why. implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness. is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience. at this my success in life and come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life of prosthetics are what other people perceive as my disability. but in fact if we are changed and we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both an ominous suggest that this is a good thing. adversity isnt an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our lives its part of our life. and i kind of think of it like my shadow sometimes i see a lot of it sometimes theres very little but its always with me. as early im not trying to diminish the impact the weight of a persons struggle there is. adversity and challenge in life and its all very real and relative to every single person but the question isnt whether or not you didnt need adversity but how youre going to need it. so our responsibility is not simply shielding knows we care for some adversity but preparing them to meet it well. and we do a disservice to our kids  when we make them feel that they are not acquit to adapt. there s an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being anti tea and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not on disabled. and truthfully the only real and consistent disability ive had to confront as the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions. in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis. or indeed a prognosis on the expected quality of their lives we have to make sure that we dont put the first break in a wall that will actually. disable summon perhaps  the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it. serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the whole mess of a percent. i m not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle in my house. we are effectively grading someones worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability. and most importantly  theres a partnership between those perceived efficiencies and our greatest creative ability. so its not about devaluing or negating needs more trying times is something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug then said to find those opportunities. wrapped in the adversity to maybe the idea what to put out there if not summit overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it. embracing it grappling with it  these are wrestling term maybe even dancing with that. and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful were less burdened by the presence of it. this year we celebrate the two hundred birthday of charles darwin and a hundred fifty years ago when writing about evolution the darling illustrated i think the truth about the human character. to paraphrase its not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survive it is the one that is most adaptable to change. conflict is the genesis of creation from darwins work amongst others we can recognize that  the human ability to survive and flourish. is driven imbibe it the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest. human scale and perhaps you know and so were tested  we are nowhere made us maybe that adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power. so we can give ourselves the guest we can re imagined adversity as something more than just tough times. maybe we can see this change adversity is just change that we havent adapted ourselves to yet. i think the greatest adversity that weve created for i felt is this idea of normalcy. it was normal   this no normal theres a common theres a typical. there s no normal and we do when a meat that poor bays person if they existed nothing stuff if we can change this paradigm from one of. achieving normalcy to one of possibility or potency could even a little bit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage. they are rare and valuable abilities that the community anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute. there s evidence that neanderthals sixty thousand years ago carry their elderly and those with serious physical injury. and perhaps its because the life experience of survival of these people proved a value to the community. they can view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable. a few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in eastern pennsylvania. and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes in the summertime had short time i hear this guy his voice behind they say well up it isnt aimee mullins. i turn around and is as older man i had no idea who he is and i said that one im sorry sir i know. having manet and i remember meeting new he said we would remember meeting me mean when we met i was delivering you can your mothers womb. id like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my to start a family that im writing anything but. i already finished editing of peace and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what id find a new bdd entry. disabled adjectives crippled helpless useless racked. stalled maimed wounded mangled lame mutilated. rundown worn out weekend in the tent castrated paralyzed handicapped. senile decrepit laid up down up down for it down and cracked out counted out. see also hurt useless and weak and cement healthy strong capable. i was reading the first out loud to a friend and at first was a laughing it was so ludicrous that had just gotten past mangled. when my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock. and in impacted yourselves from these words unleashed. and i am i scores that is might raggedy all the star s im thinking this must be an ancient print date right but in fact and twenty eight was the early nineteen eighties. when i would have then that starting primary school in forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids in the world around me and needless to say thank god i wasnt using at the star s background. and it has from this entry it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have it nothing positive whatsoever going for them when in fact today. i m celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life have for cheer so on i immediately. when to look at the two thousand nine eye on line edition expecting to find a revision worth noting  heres the updated version of this entry. unfortunately its not that much better than i find the the last few words on or near ants nems particularly unsettling hole and wholesome. so its not just about the words. its what we believe about people when we named them with these words to doubt the values behind the words and how we construct those values  our language effects are thinking. and how we view the world and how we view other people is that many ancient societies including the greeks the romans believed that to other a curse. verbal he was so powerful because to say this thing out loud brought it into existence. so what reality do we want to call into existence the person who is limited or person who is empowered. i casually doing something as simple as naming a person a childs. we might be putting width and casting shadows on their power when we want to open doors for them instead. one such person open doors for me with my child the doctor at the ai decline institute in wilmington delaware his name is dr peter to love. i am ten telling americans name a pet is too difficult for most americans a pronounced so you have by dr p and dr t. always wear really colorful bow ties and them have been very perfect disposition to work with children. i love almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical therapy sessions. i had to do what seem like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands at different colors you know. to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names to them and heated them and. a no i was already bargaining at the five year old child with dr t try to get adding effects divers unsuccessfully of course. and one day he came in to my stepson now im exhaustive and unforgiving. the sessions and he said to me laugh in the u s such a strong and powerful little girl. i think youre going to break one of those bands when you do break it among give you a hundred box now corinth if this was a simple ploy. and dr p parts to get me to do the exercises i didnt want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward. but what he effectively did for me was re shape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me. and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me. as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future. this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child. now that guy who thought  and the fourth actually. it did click this mammoth dr teen  and then that only known about to my mother stories of that day because of course. typical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks and so my mothers prenatal physician had gone on vacation so the man delivered me with a complete stranger to my parents. and because i was born without the fiddler bones and then he turned in a few toes in this but it because in that he had to be the bear the stranger. had to be the bearer of bad news he said to me what i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk. and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence and even making a liar atom he ever since. the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole tiles that. whether at winning a second great spelling bee marching with the girl scouts of the other halloween frayed winning my college scholarship for any of my youth sports victories. and he was using it in integrating into teaching at residents students med students from hahnemann. medical school and hershey medical school and he called this part of the course the x factor is the potential of the human will. no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be emitted as a determinant in the quality of someones life. in dr keenan on to tell me that he said in my experience  unless repeatedly told otherwise. and even if given a monomer modicum of support if left to their own devices a child will a cheat. the doctor keen made that shift in thinking he understood that theres a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it. there s been a shift in my thinking over time and that if youd asked me and fifteen years old if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone might i wouldnt have hesitated for a second. i aspired to that kind of normalcy held back then if he asked me today im not so sure. and its the cause of the experiences ive had with them not in spite of the experiences ive had with them. and perhaps the shift in me has happened because ive been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me. all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and youre off if you can hand somebodys the key. to their own power of the human spirit is so respected if you can do that to open a door for someone at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense. you teaching them to open doors for themselves the fact of the exact meaning of the word educate. comes in the root word reduce it means to bring forth what is within to bring out potential so again which potential do we want to bring out. there is a case study done in the nineteen sixties britain when they were moving from cabrera grammar schools to comprehensive schools cut the streaming trouser caught tracking. here in the states its separating students with a b c d and so on. and yet the ace tunes get the top or curriculum the best teachers except that well its just over a three month period the level students gave the maze told them they were raised told them they were bright and at the end of this three month period. they were performing at a level that course the heartbreaking flip side of the study is that they took the ace students. and told him they were ds and thats what happened at the end of that three month period those who were still around and school five to drop people had dropped out. this is a crucial part of the of this case study was that the teachers were duped too. the teachers didnt know us which had been made they were simply told these are the ace tunes these are the d students and thats how they when about teaching them. and treating them so i think. at the only true disability. is it crashed spirit a spirit thats been crashed doesnt have hope it doesnt see beauty. it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity and i made ability to imagine. if instead we can bolster human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others. to be curious and imaginative and then we are truly using our power well. when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being. id like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century persian poet name half its feet. and my friends at them wife told me map and a poem is called the guide who only knows forwards  every child,"['beauty','body language','design']"
BillGates_2009.stm,. the temperature will continue to rise and so thats thats a big challenge its very different than saying in a work twelve but the high proc trying to get under a ten foot bridge and we can just sort of squeegees under this is something that has to get to zero. now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year are over twenty six billion times are for each american. its about twenty times are for people in poor countries its less than one time than average about five times for everyone on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero. it s been constantly going on its only in various economic changes that have even find at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and fall in all the way to zero this equation has four factors. a little bit a multiplication so youve got a thing on the last year or two that you want to get to zero and thats going to be based on the number of people. the services each person jews in on average the energy on average freak service and the ceo to being put out. a pert unit of energy so lets look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero ill probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near the cyril. how that back to my eyes go out there but lets lets take a look at our first we got population. a the world today has six point eight billion people thats headed up to about nine billion now three do a really great job on new vaccines health care. reproductive health services we could or that by perhaps ten or fifteen percent but there we see an increase of love about one point three. the second factor is the services we use this in compass is everything the food we ate. clothing t v i hed mean these are very good things and getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet and its a great thing. i offer this number to go up in the rich world perhaps atop one billion we probably could cut back in his last but every year. this number on average is going to go out and so overall that will more than double the services delivered per person. here we have a very basic services do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your home or and in fact these kids dont so theyre going out reading their school work under the street lamps. now efficiency eat the energy freak service here finally we have some good news we have something thats not going up through various inventions in new ways of doing lighting. out through a different types of cars of different ways of building buildings there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy to that service down quite substantially. some individual services even bring it down by ninety percent there are other services like how we make fertilizer or how we do where transport or the rooms for improvement are far far last. and so overall here if were optimistic we may get a reduction of of a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of sex. but for these first three factors now weve got from twenty six billion to it basked on maybe thirteen billion times and that just wont cut it so lets look at this fourth factor  i was going to be eighty one. and this is the amount of seo troop look out for each unit of energy and so the question is can you actually get that to zero out if you burn coal. no up you burn natural gas to almost every way you make electricity today except for the emerging renewables and nuclear outputs out sio two and so were going to have to do with a global scale. is create a new system and so we need the energy miracles now why is the term miracle i dont mean something thats impossible. the microprocessor as a miracle of personal computers a miracle of the internet that services are merkel so the people here curtis updated in the creation of many miracles usually little have a deadline. where you have to get the miracle by a certain date usually discounted stam buying some col on some doll this is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed in get a miracle innate a pretty tight timeline. now i thought how could i really capture this is there some kind of natural illustration some demonstration that would grab peoples imagination here. i thought back to your goal when i brought mosquitoes and somehow people enjoyed that. it really got them involved in the idea that you know other people live mosquito so when energy all i could come up with is this how i decided that really seen fireflies. with the maya a contribution to the environment here this year so here he abba some type of fireflies im told they dont buy in fact they might even not evenly that jar. now theres all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that ones are but they dont really add up to much we need solutions either one or several that have. unbelievable scale and numbly ball reliability and although theres many directions are people seeking i really only see five dead. can achieve the big numbers and left out tied geothermal fusion biofuels those may make some contribution and if they can do better than i expect so much the better but my key point here. has known god not the god of names not the god of doughnuts but the guide who only knows forwards. and keeps repeating them saying come dance with me calm  dance with me thank you. how im going to talk today about energy and climate. and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work of the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds about the things that we need to invent in the liver to help the poorest two billion live better lives. but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet. the climate getting worse means that many years their crops on parole a bit too much rain not enough rain. things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply cant support and that leads to starvation least uncertainty it leads some rasp of so that the climate changes will be terrible for them. also the price of energy is very important to them in fact if you could pick just one thing the lower the price out to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down over time. are really advanced civilization as based on in the advances in in energy the cold revolution fueled. the industry revolution and even in the nineteen hundreds weve seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity on thats why we have refrigerators air conditioning we can make our modern materials and do so many things. and so were in it wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world. but as we make it cheaper and lets say lets go for making it to a place is cheap we need to mean a new constraints. in that constraint has to do with sio two sio two is warming the planet. and the equation on sio two is actually are a very straightforward won it you sum up the ceo to that gets emitted. that leads to a temperature increase and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects effects on the weather. of droughts worse the indirect effects in that i loved it natural ecosystems cant to just to these rapid changes and so you get ecosystem collapses. now the exact amount of how you map from a a certain increase in of seo too. to what temperature will be in where the positive feedbacks arthur some uncertainty there but not very much and theres certainly uncertainty about how bad those effect will be but they will be extremely bad. i asked the top scientists in the several times to we really have to get down to near zero cant we just in a cut in half or a quarter and the answer is that until we get here to zero. between us and china between poor countries are rich and most of all the lines of those two billion will be far worse so what do we have to do what and my appealing as due to a step gordon. and drive we needed to go for more research funding in one countries get together a place like opening a nation. just discussed the c o two they should discuss this innovation agenda and youd be stand at the room ridiculously low levels of spending. on these innovative approaches we do need the market and status sio two packs cap and trade something that gets that price signal out there. we need to get the message out we need to have this style of be a more rational more understandable by a log on including the steps of the government takes this is an important wish but it is one i think we can achieve thank you. . thank you have said to understand more about about that terrapower right of them. and for salt will give a sense what so the scale of investment the sieve. what did he actually do this software by the supercomputer higher all the great scientists which weve done thats only tens of millions and even once we test our materials out. in a rush reactor to make sure that our materials work properly then youll only be up in hundreds of millions the top thing is building the pilot reactor. offline he knows several billion are finding the the regulator that location that will actually build the first one of these once you get the first one built. if it works as advertised then it is clear as day because the economics the energy density are so different than nuclear as we know it. and so to understand it right this involves building deep into the ground and suchlike a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel of this so the spent uranium and then and then it and then the process starts at the top and kind of work down. thats right to beat youre always reviewing the reactor sea of lots of people on lots of controls that can go wrong that thing were opening it up and moving things in and out that. thats not good so if you have a very very cheap fuel that you can put sixty years in just think of it as a log. put it down and not have those same complexities and it just sits there and burns for the sixty years and and then its done. if that its a nuclear popped on the is its own waste disposal solution. yet what happens with the ways you can you can let it sit there on others a lot less waste under this approach are then you can actually take out and put it into another one amber a map. and we start out actually by taking the waste that exists today that sitting in these cooling pools of dry cask invite reactors thats our fuel. to begin with so the thing thats been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets that in bars in your reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as are going through this process. i think youre talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here where where is the most interested and actually doing something with this. well we havent picked a particular place but about it theres all these interesting disclosure rules of how about any nuts called nuclear. so it with weve got a lot of interest that people from the company and then in russia india china and ive been vaccine the sector of energy here talking about how this. of fits into the the energy agenda some optimistic in the french in japanese have done some work this is eighty variant on something that has been done its an important. advanced but its like a fast reactor in a lot of pump countries have built them so anybody whos done faster actor is a candidate to to be where the first one gets built. so in in your mind time scale unlikelihood of actually taken seven like this life. what we need for one of these. i still a leopard electoral generation things thats very cheap we have twenty years to invent and then twenty years to the point that sort of the deadline. that the environments environmental models of have have shown us that we have to meet and in and terrapower if things go well. which is wishing for a lot could easily meet that and there are hardcore chilling now thousands of companies we need to be hundreds. likewise if their science goes well up dead funding for their plant pile plants goes well that date they can compete for this and its best that multiple succeed because they need to use a mix a mix of these things we certainly need one to succeed. in terms of big scale possible game changes this is the biggest that youre aware about them. and energy breakthrough is the  the most important thing it would have been even without the environmental concern for the environment constrict just thinks that so much. so much greater in the nuclear space there are other innovators in a we dont know their work has well as we know this one but. the modular people on thats a different approach theres a liquid type reactor which seems little harder maybe they sail about us. and so theyre there are different ones but they ate the beauty of this is that molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of state coal. and so if you can deal with them maybe its the truth so essentially the radiation the foot printing costs the potential in terms of the effect on land and theres things he is in almost any class of that song. if this doesnt work. then watch do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable. yet you get into that situation its like. if your. you been overeating and youre about to have a heart attack in of and then then where do you go you may need heart surgery something there is a line of research on whats called geo engineering. which are various techniques that with the lady heaney tobias twenty or thirty years to get our act together. now you hope thats just an insurance policy hope you dont need to do that some people station even work on the entrance pulse because it might make you. lazy that youll keep eating because you know heart surgery would be there to save you im not sure thats wise given the importance of a problem but. others now that the geo engineering discussion about should that be in the back pocket in key things happen faster for this innovation those a lot slower than weeks back. climate skeptics if you had to earn a sentence or two to say to them about how might you persuade them that theyre wrong. well im totally the skeptics come in different camps i mean the ones who make scientific arguments are very few. you know there are the same that theres may give feedback effect they have to do with clouds that off sat things theyre very very few things that they can even say you know theres a chance and a million of those things the main problem we have here. its kind like eight you make the mistake now you paid for it a lot lately and so when you have all sorts of urgent problems the idea of taking pay now. that has to do with a game layer at a somewhat uncertain a painting in fact the i p c c report you know that. that s not necessarily the worst case and there are people in the rich world look i p c c and say ok you know that that isnt that big a deal the fact is its the that on certain part. that should move as towards us but my dream here is that if you can make an economic and meet the c o two constraint then the skeptics say ok. i dont care that it doesnt put out seared like and we should did put out it too but i guess all accept it because its cheaper. whats come before. . of out of your response to the the bjorn lomborg argument that basically if you if you spend all this energy trying to solve this year to problem its going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty malaria suffer that since it is that this is stupid waste of the earths resources to put money towards that when there have better things we can do. yet all the actual spending on the r d peace ed you dont say the u s should spend ten billion a year more than it is right now its not that dramatic tension take away from other things that then you get into big money on. and this result deep in disgrace when you have some moves noneconomic in are trying to fund that that to me mostly is a waste unless youre very close to me this funding the learning curve and its going to get very cheap i believe we should try it no more. things that have the potential to be far less expensive if the trade off you get into his lets make energy super and super or. of expensive then the rich can afford that me all of us here could pay five times as much for energy and not change our lifestyle. the disaster is so that two billion and even lomborg has changed his stick now is wise and the r d. i getting more discounts t he still because of his earlier stuff sort of associated with a skeptic camp but hes relies thats thats a pretty lonely cap and and so. he s making the r d point and and so theres a of dread of something that i need is a prop it beyond the pc its crazy how little its pond. although i suspect side has become off of most people here to say i really hope youll wish comes true thank you so much. i guess. is that were going to have to work on each of these five and we cant give up any of them because they it they look daunting because they all. have significant challenges a lets look first at that burning fossil fuels either a burning coal burning natural gas what you need to do there. seems like it might be simple but its not and thats to take all the ceo to after you burn it going out the flu pressurize that create a liquid put it somewhere and hope it stays there. now we have some pilot things that do this that the sixty to eighty percent level but getting up to that full percentage that will be very tricky and a green on where these sio two feet while you should be put. will be hard but the toughest one here is this long term issue whos going to be sure whos going to guaranteed. as something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of them in terms of nuclear other things this is a lot of on. so thats a top long necks in the nobler it also has three big problems cost particularly in highly rated it countries is high. the issue of the safety really feeling good about nothing can go wrong that he did all you have these human operators that the fuel. it doesnt get used for weapons and then where it what you do with the waste although its not very large other a lot of concerns about that people needed so good about it so three very top problems are that might be a solvable and so should be worked on. the last three of the five id group together of these are what people often referred to as the renewable sources and they actually. all its rate they dont file fuel they have some disadvantages one is that the density. and energy gather in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant this is energy farming. so youre talking about many square miles thousands of times more area then it then you think of as a normal energy plant also these are intermittent sources the sun doesnt shine. all day it doesnt shine every day in likewise the wind doesnt blow all the time and so the depend on these sources. you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods but its not available so we got big cost challenges here. now we have transmission challenges for example say this energy sources outside your country are you not only need the technology but you have to do with the rest of the energy coming from elsewhere and finally this storage problem. in dimensionalize this i went through and look that all the types of batteries that get made for cars for computers for phones for flashlights for everything in compared that. to the amount of electrical energy the world uses and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than ten minutes. of all the energy and so in fact we need a big breakthrough here something thats going to be. of factor of a hundred better than the approaches we have now its not its not impossible but its not a very easy thing now this shows up when you try to get to recruit the internet was forced to be a bob say twenty to thirty percent. of what youre using if your county not for a hundred percent you need aid and incredible miracle battery. now how were going to go forward on this whats whats the right approach is that a band hand project whats that the thing that can get us there what we need lots. of companies a working on this hundreds in each of these bypass we need least one hundred people a lot of a meal look and say theyre crazy thats good. and i think here in a ted group we have many people have already pursuing this. bill gross has several companies including one called the solar that has some great solar thermal technology of the node pull saws invest in and dozens of companies are that are doing great things in have interesting possibilities and um im trying to help back that i made the myrtle than i actually are backing that a company. that perhaps surprisingly is actually taking the nuclear product of there are some innovations in nuclear modular liquid. hot and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some time ago so the idea that theres some good ideas lane around on is not all that surprising the idea that terror power. is that instead of burning that part of uranium the one percent does the u two thirty five we decided lets burn the ninety nine percent. the u two thirty eight it s kind of a crazy idea and in fact people have talked about for a long time. but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not and should serve the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right. with pearls approach on this looks like it would work in because youre burning at ninety nine percent now you have. greatly improved cost a profile you actually burn up the waste and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from todays reactors so instead of worrying about them it is take that its a great thing. it breeds this uranium as it goes along so its kind of like the candle in soups its a log there are often referred to as a traveling wave reactor in terms of fuel. this really solve the problem ive got a picture here have a place in kentucky this is the left over the ninety nine percent were theyve taken out the party bernau so called depleted uranium that would power the u s. for hundreds of years and simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process you have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet so. you know its got lots lots of challenges they had but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward. so lets think how should we measure ourselves what should our report card a look like lets go out to where we really need to get in and then a look at the intermediate for twenty fifty youve heard many people talk about. this eighty percent reduction that really is very important that we get there and that twenty percent will be used up by. things going on in poor countries still some agriculture are hopefully we will have cleaned up of forestry cement up so to get to that eighty percent the developed countries. including countries like china will have had to switch their like printing electricity generation all together are so the other great is are we deploying. this zero emission technology ive we deployed it in all the developed countries and were in the processes of getting that up elsewhere that super important. thats a key element of making that report card so backing up from there what should the twenty twenty report card look like. well it again it should have the two elements now we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting redactions the less we met the last that some will be of sio two in their pour the last the temperature but in some ways the grade we get there. doing things that dont get us all the way to the bigger adoptions is only equally or maybe even slightly less important in the other which is that piece of innovation. on these breakthroughs these breakthroughs we need to move those at full speed and we can measure that in terms of companies pilot projects regulatory things that have been chain. theres a lot of great books the memory of about this the al gore book our choice and the david maathai book sustainable energy without the hot air they really go through it and i think can greater a framework that this can be discussed probably because we need brod backing for this. others a lot has to come together so this is a wish its a very concrete with that. we invent this technology if you gave me only one way for the next fifty years i can pick was president i can pick the vaccine. which is something i love or i could pick that this thing thats half the cost of no sio two gets invented. this is the wish i would pick this is the one with the greatest impact if we dont get this wish the division between the people who think short term or long term will be terrible,"['business','education','health']"
DanBarber_2008P.stm,. sid what percentage. of your feed his chicken. thinking in a two percent. i was about thirty percent he said. i sit down. what sustainable about feeding check in to fish. but there is a long cars on the line. and he said theres just too much chicken in the world. i fell out of love with this fish. not because im some self writers goody two shoes foodie. i actually am. i ve come out of this fish because its what a guy after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken. this second fish. but a different kind of love story. its the romantic time. the kind where the more you get to know your fish you love the fish. i first eight at a restaurant in southern spain. a journalist friend and talking about this fish for a long time. hannah set us up. they came to the table are bright. on most shimmering white collar. the chef had overcooked are like twice of amazingly it was still delicious. who can make a fish taste good. after its been overcooked. i can but this guy cant. lets call him media are actually his name is medium. and not needing cook the fish and is not a chef at least the way you and i understand it. is a biologist. and thats a la palma its a fish farm in the south western corner spain. its at the tip of the guano to veer river. until the nineteen eighties the farmers in the hands of the argentinians. they raise beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands. they did it by draining land they built this intricate series of canals. and they push water off the land out into the river. but i couldnt make it where i economically. and ecologically it was a disaster. the like ninety percent of the birds which for this place a lot of birds. and so a nineteen eighty two. the spanish company with an environmental conscience purchase the land what are they do it. they were burst the flow of water they literally flip the switch. so the pushing water out. they use the channels to pull water back and they flooded the canals. they created a twenty seven thousand acre fish five. bats malek shrimp eel. any in the process of me down and this company. completely reversed ecological destruction. the farms incredible  i mean youve never seen anything like this. you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are flooded canals and this bit rich marshland. i was then on go with me out. he s an amazing guy. like three parts charles darwin in one part crocodile dundee. . there we are flying to the wetland. non panting and sway im about to my knees and the gals calmly conducting a biology lecture. here is pointing out a rare by actual the kite. now its mentioning. the mineral needs of phytoplankton. i know a lot of fish in my life. i ve loved only too. at first one was there. it was more like a passionate affair. it was a beautiful fish. flavorful textured. midi the bestseller on the menu what a fish. even then there it was farm raised to the suppose that highest standards of sustainability. so you could feel good about selling it. i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months. one day they had a company called and asked if id speak at an event. about the farm sustainability absolutely i said. heres the company trying to sell. whats become this unimaginable problem fresh us. and we keep fish on our menus. for the past fifty years we the fishing the seas. like we clear cut for us. it s hard to overstate the destruction. ninety percent a large fish the ones we love the tunas the how thats the sammons swordfish the collapsed  there was nothing left. so for better or for worse aquaculture fish farming be a part of our future. a lot of arguments against it. fish farms bullet. most of them do it and theyre inefficient take tuna major drawback. got a feed conversion ratio of fifteen to one that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm to him. not very sustainable than days very dear to you. so here finally. was a company trying to do it right now wonder supporter. the day before the then i called the head of pr for the company. with call him down. down as it is to get the facts are you guys are famous for for farming so far out to sea you dont pollute thats right he said were so far out. the waste or my fish gets distributed. that concentrate and then ied. were basically a world and to ourselves. at the conversion ratio two point five no one he said best in the business. by five one great thing to put on what what would he feeds sustainable proteins he said. great i said got off the phone. and then when i was lying in bed i thought. what the hell is a sustainable protein. so the next day just before the event i called the eyes and now what are some examples of sustainable proteins that even now. they would ask around why bountiful a few people in the company no one can give me a straight answer. until finally i got on the phone with the head biologist. lets call him down too. down i said what are some examples of sustainable proteins. when mentions analogies. as and fish males and then he said chicken pellets. the chicken parts he said yeah fair skin. mo neon scraps dried and processed in the sea. they do that because they are able to follow the broken the white line on highway eighty ninety two. no kidding. now i was imagining a march of the penguins thank you now so i looked in the guy said. maybe ill do they fly one hundred and fifty miles to the farm. and then do they fly one hundred and fifty miles back at night. do they do that for the children. he looked to me like i just go to the whitney houston song. he said now they do all kinds of foods better. yeah i didnt mention the skin of my beloved fish. which was delicious and i dont like fishkin i dont like it seer it on a liking crispy. as the acrid tar like flavor. i was never cook with it. yet when i tasted it at that restaurant in southern spain it tasted not at all like this skin. it tasted sweet in clean. like you are taking a bite of the ocean. i mention that in the galley natalie said the skin and so i just find so last offense for planning enters the body it involved. to soak up impurities and then he added. but our water has no impurities. ok a farm that doesnt mean its fish. a farm that measures of success. by the success of its predators. and then i realize when he says. a farm and has no impurities he made a big on a statement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the wide open your river. so were going to carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days. chemical contaminants pesticide runoff. and when it works its way through the system. and leaves the water is cleaner than when it enters. the system is so healthy it purifies the water. so not just a farmer doesnt feed its owls not just the farm measures the hell. the its success by the health of this predators. but a farm is literally a water purification plan. and not just for those fish. but for you and me as well because were now wider liza dumps out into the atlantic. a drop in the ocean i know but ill take it and so should you. because this love story. however romantic is also instructive. you might say its a recipe for the future of good food. whether were talking about bess or beef cattle. what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture one in which the food actually taste good. help for a lot of people. thats a bit too radical up. but were not really s ice foodies. were lovers. we love farmers markets we love small family farms. we talk about local food we eat organic. and when you suggest these are the things that will ensure. the future of good food someone somewhere stands up and says hey gag. i love pink flamingos i dont feed the world. harry and feed the world and ill be honest i dont love that question. no not because we already produced an art galleries to more than feed the world. and here here he sees a grouping patterned their minds him of the tanzanian giraffe. it turns out me now spent the better part of his career in them a cool new national park in africa. i asked him how i became such an expert on fish and fish. by knowing about fish. i m an expert in relationships. and then ease off. launching into more talk about a rare birds and algae is and strange aquatic plants dont get me wrong i was really fascinate you know the biotic community unplugged kind of thing you know its great. but i was in love and my head. was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious face i had the night before so i interrupted lessening now what makes your fish taste so good. the point at the algae. i know do the algae the phytoplankton the relationships its as amazing. right but what if they speedy whats the feed conversion ratio. we goes on to tell me. its such a rich system. that the fish are eating what the meeting a while. the plant biomass to fight applied to zooplankton its what feeds the fish the system is so healthy its totally self or nailing. there is no fee. ever heard of a farm the doesnt feed its animals. later that day i was driving around this property with me down i ask them is that for places seems so natural. unlike any fish the allegheny farm ive ever been act. how do you measure success. but that moment its as if the film director called for a sex change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight thousands and thousands of pink flamingos. a literal pink carpet first far as you could say. that success he said. look at their bellies think theyre feasting. the thing throw it into the sydney gap and the feasting on your fish. yes he said. we lose twenty percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds. i will last year this property had six hundred thousand birds on. more than two hundred and fifty different species its become today the largest. and one of the most important. private bird sanctuaries in all of europe. i said miguel isnt a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm. he should snl he said. we farm expensively. not intensively. this is the ecological network. the flamingos eat the shrimp should be the phytoplankton so that they could a belly the better the system. but thats what serve you find that doesnt feed its animals. and a fireman measures of success. on the health of its predators. a fish farm but also bird sanctuary. on bottlenose flamingos they should even be there in the first place. they brewed in a town one hundred and fifty miles away where the soil conditions are better for building nests. every morning they fly one hundred and fifty miles into the farm. and every evening if i were fifty miles back,"['entertainment','food','global issues']"
JaneMcGonigal_2012G.stm,. recently scientists have suggested that her righteous is crazy story is actually true and geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly twenty years that could explain the famine so this crazy story might be true they might have actually. saved their culture by playing games escaping to games for eighteen years and then this so inspired and a new so much about how to come together with games that they actually save the entire civilization outlet okay we can do that. we ve been playing more passes ninety nine before that was the first real time strategy game from the world of warcraft series that was sixteen years ago. they played a schemes for eighteen years we complain or pass for sixteen years i say we are ready for our own at that game now. they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world so thats where i get my twenty one billion hours a week of gameplay. from lets get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games until we solve real world problems now i know youre asking. how are we going to solve real problems in games well thats what i had to go to my work to over the past few years at the institute for the future. we have a spanner in our offices in palo alto and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future we do not want to try to predict the future but we want to do is make the future. we want to imagine the best case scenario app calm and we want to empower people to make that outcome reality we want to imagine epic wins and they give people the means to achieve the epoch when. and this going to very briefly show you three games that ive made that are in a tent to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures. so this is world without oil we made this came in two thousand seven this is an online game in which he tried to survive and oil shortage. the oil shortage is fictional but we put enough online content out there for you believe that its real and to live your real life as if weve run out of oil so when you come to the game. you sign up you tell us where you live and then we give you real time news videos to how to feed set show you exactly how much oil cost whats not available health food supplies being affected how transportation is being affected the schools are closed if theres a variety and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true and then we ask you to blog about it. to post videos of posts photos the pilot in this game the seventeen hundred players in two thousand seven and we tracked them for the three years sense and i can tell you that this is a chance formative experience nobody wants to change how they live just because. it s good for the world or because riskless you but if you immerse them and an epic adventure and tell them. if you find out of oil this is an amazing story in adventure for you dont want to challenge yourself to see how you would survive most of our players have kept up the habits they were in this game. so the next world saving and we decide to aim higher bigger problem than just people oil on we did a keen call super stopped at the institute for the future. and the pan this was a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only twenty three years left on the planet the supercomputer was called the global extinction awareness system of course we ask people to come on line almost like a jerry bruckheimer movie. new jerry bruckheimer movies you form a dream team youve got the ash not the scientists the ex convict and they all have something to do to save the world. but in our game said just having five people on the dream team we said everybodys on the dream team and its your job. to invent the future of energy the future of food the future of health the future of security and the future of the social safety net. maybe eight thousand people play that game for eight weeks they came up with five hundred in seen the creative solutions that you can go online if you google superstar and see. so finally the last game were watching at much third this is a game then with the world bank institute if you complete the game you will be. certified by the world bank in situ as a social innovator class of two thousand ten working with universities all over subsaharan africa and were inviting them to learn social innovation skills weve got a graphic novel. we ve got leveling opt in skills like local insight knowledge networking sustainability vision and resourcefulness i would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people anywhere in the world particularly in developing areas you might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world. some to wrap up now i want to ask the question what do you think happens next weve got all these amazing cameras weve got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do but none of them to save the real world yet. well i hope that you will agree with me that gamers are in human resource that we can use. to do real world work that games are powerful platform for change we have all these amazing superpowers blissful productivity the ability to weave a tight social fabric this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning i really hope that we can come together. to play games that matter to survive on this planet for another century and thats my hope that you will join me in making him playing games like this when i look forward to the next decade i know two things for shore. that we can make any future we can imagine and we can play any games we want so i say that the world changing games began thank you. i try to apply that same principle of leadership which is that it you respect your team and you earn their respect in return and it really change the dynamic to hero was again with a small team. and you know in uncharted territory doing avatar coming up with new technology that didnt exist before tremendously exciting on tremendously challenging and we became a family. over four and a half year period it completely changed how i do movies so people of comment on how we all of you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet pandora to me was more of a fundamental way of doing business the process itself that changed as a result for them. so what can we synthesize out of all this you know whats that what are the lessons learned well number one of his curiosity its the most powerful thing you own imagination. is a force that can actually manifest a reality and the respective your team is more important than all book laurels in the world. i had young filmmakers. come up to me and say didnt give me some advice for doing this. and i said. though put limitations on yourself other people do that for you dont do it yourself film but against yourself and and take risks up a nasa has us  has this stuff for is that they like failure is not an option. but still you have to be an option in art and an exploration because its a leap of faith and no important endeavor that require innovation. was done without rest you have to be willing to take those risks so thats a thought i would leave you with is that in whatever youre doing failure. is an option but here is not take it. i m a game designer i to making games online out for ten years and out my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to see the world in real life has it is to see the world in our mind games. now i have a plan for this and it entails convincing more people including all of you to spend more time. playing bigger and better games right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games some of you might be thinking. thats a lot of time to spend playing games maybe too much time considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world and that actually according to my research at the institute for the future and its actually the opposite is true. three billion hours a week is not nearly enough gameplay to solve the worlds most urgent problems on in fact. i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we need to increase that total dramatically i ve calculated the total we need at twenty one billion hours of gameplay every week. syrup thats probably a bit of a counterintuitive ideas there are just as say it again let it sink and f we want to solve problems like hunger poverty climate change global conflict obesity. i believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least twenty one billion hours a week by the end of the next decade. no im serious. i am here is why this picture pretty much sums up why i think teams are so essential to the future survival of the human species through it. they still portrayed by a photographer named phil told on and he wanted to capture the emotion of gaming so he set the camera in front of gamers while they were planning and this is a classic. gaining a motion now i if youre not a game or you might miss some the nuance in this photo youve probably see this sense of urgency a little bit of. fear but intense concentration deep deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem im if you are a game or you will notice a few nuances here the crinkle of the eyes up and around the mouth is a sign of optimism and hope rolls up to surprise this is a gamer who is on the verge of something called an epic wayne now. how you turn that al qaeda and so we have some gamers among us so and i think when it is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea it was even possible and so you achieved it on it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination. and when you get there you are shocked to discover what you truly capable up thats an epic way. this is a gamer on the verge of an epic wing and this is the face that we need to see on millions are problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century the face of someone. china brazil can get online expect one billion more gamers the next decade for things to one point five billion gamers. so i started to think about what these games are making s virtuous as accurate a four things i came up with. the first is urgent optimism k think of this is extreme self motivation urgent optimism is a desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success. gamers always believe that an epic when as possible and is always worth trying and trying now gamestop sit around. kate gamers are virtuous those and weaving at tate social fabric s a lot of interesting research that shows that these like people better after we play a game of and even if theyd beaten us badly. the reason is it takes a lot of trust to play gain the someone we trusted they will spend their time with us that he will play by the same rules value the same goal will stay with the game until as over and so tiny game together actually builds up ponds and trust and cooperation on and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result. blissful productivity and levitt use a reason why the average world of warcraft gamer plays for twenty two hours a week and a half time job its because we know when were playing the game that were actually happier working harder than we are. relaxing or hanging out we know that were optimizes human beings who do hardy meaningful work and gamers are willing to work hard all the time if theyre given the right work finally at the convening. gamers love to detach to are inspiring missions to human planetary scale stories to just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective on so you all know which he pdf. biggest witty in the world second biggest wiki in the world with nearly eighty thousand articles is the world of warcraft wiki. five million people use it every month they have compiled for more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other topics covered on any other with the in the world they are building an epic story they are building it epic knowledge resource about the world of warcraft okay so these are for super powers that had app. to one thing gamers are super empowered hopeful individuals. these are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world and the only problem is they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world thats a problem that im trying to self. on this in economising ever casanova his work as brilliant he looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds. and he says were witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds an online game environments and hes an economist so hes rational and he says. now let me and a game designer and exuberant but he says he says. that this makes perfect sense because gamers can achieve more in online worlds and they can in real life they can have stronger social relationships in games and they can have in real life they get their feedback and feel more rewarding in games and they do in real life so he says. for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds in the real world now. i also agree that that is rational for now but it is not by any means and optimal situation we have to start making the real world war more like the game so i take my inspiration from something that happened. twenty five hundred years ago these are ancient ice made out of sheeps knuckles right before we had awesome game controllers we had sheep goats and sad these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings. if youre familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian hurghada test you might know this history on which is the history of who invented games and why. right to says that teams particularly dice games were invented in the kingdom of lydia during a time of fan apparently there was such a severe famine. that their keen of lydia decided they had to do something crazy people were suffering people were fighting it was an extreme situation they needed an extreme solution. cell according to run a test they invented dice games and they set up the kingdom wide policy. on one day everybody would eat and on the next day everybody would play games and they would be so immersed in playing the dice games because games are so engaging and immerse us as a satisfying blissful productivity. they would ignore the fact they had no food to eat and then on the next day he would play games and on the next day they would eat and according to run he says. the past eighteen years this way surviving there were famine that eating on monday and playing games on the next now this is exactly i think how were using games today. were using games to escape real world suffering for using games to get away from everything thats broken in the real environment everything thats not satisfied about real life. and were getting what we needed from games but it doesnt have to end there this is really exciting according to who brought it to us after eighteen years the famine wasnt getting better so the cane decided they would play one final basting. they divided the entire kingdom and half he played one dyson and the winners of that team got to go. on an epic adventure they would leave lydia and they would go out in search of a new place to live leaving behind just enough people. to survive on the resources that were available and hopefully to take a civilization somewhere else where they could thrive now this sounds crazy right. but recently dna evidence has shown that the etruscans who then led to the roman empire actually share the same dna as each ingredient and so. who against all odds is on the verge of an epic wing now unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems this is what i call the im not good at life face and has actually need. making it easy to his kit on this is actually mean making the im not that of life face on this is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in berkeley california where i did my phd on why were better in games than we are in real life and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games and i dont mean just good is unsuccessful although thats part of it we do achieve more in game worlds but also mean good it has in motivated to do something that matters inspired to collaborate and cooperate and one marine game worlds. i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves the most likely to help at a moments notice the most likely to stick with a problem as long as it takes to get up after failure and try again on and in real life. when weeks when we face failure when we can find obstacles we often dont feel that way we feel over calm we feel overwhelmed we feel anxious may be depressed frustrated or a cynical. we never have this feeling from a plane gains be just on existing games so thats what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student  what about games makes it impossible to feel that we cant achieve everything how can we. take the those feelings from games and apply them to real world were so that the games like world of warcraft which is really the ideal collaborative problem solving environment and i said its knows the few things that make. epic wind so possible an online world so the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games especially in world of warcraft there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world saving mission. right away but not just any nation as a nation that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game right so you can do it they never give you a challenge that you can achieve. but it isnt that the verge of what youre capable of so you have to try hard but theres no and implanted in world of warcraft theres no sitting around in your hands is always something specific. and important to be done and theyre also towns and clap readers everywhere you go out hundreds of thousands of people. ready to work with you to achieve your attic mission as not something we have in real life that easily the sense that at our fingertips our times of collaborators and also this is epic story is inspiring story of i were there. and what were doing and then we get all this positive feedback you guys have heard of levelling up and plus one strengthened plus wants intelligence out we dont get that kind of constant feedback in real life i get up to speed im not going to have your class mind speaking in class in line. crazy idea arm plus twenty crazy idea i am i dont get their feedback in real life and now the problem with collaborative online and im its like world of warcraft. is that its so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic when all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game world this is better than reality to so far on collectively all the world of warcraft gamers have spent five point nine fifty million years solving the virtual problems of as around now. thats not necessarily a bad thing in my salad is a bad thing but to put that in context five point nine three million years ago with plan. our earliest primate human ancestors stood up that was the first up bright primate okay so when we talk about how much time are currently investing in playing games. the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution on which is an extraordinary thing but its also apt because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games were actually changing. what we are capable of as human beings were evolving to be more collaborative and hardy species this is true i believe its so consider this really interesting statistic. i was recently published by researcher at carnegie mellon university the average young person today in a country with a strong team or culture. let spent ten thousand hours playing online games by the age of twenty watt at ten thousand hours is a really interesting member for two reasons first of all. for children in united states ten thousand eighty hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance. so we have an entire parallel track of education going line where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as their learning about everything else in school. the some of you have probably read malcolm gladwell s new book outliers so you would have heard of his theory of successive ten thousand hours theory of six that its based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master. ten thousand hours of effortful study at anything by the age of twenty one we will be virtuoso that we will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world calm and so. now what were looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers so the big question is. what exactly are gamers of getting so good act because if we can figure that out we would have been virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands. this is how many people we now have in the world to spend at least an hour a day playing online games these are a virtuoso demers five hundred million people who are extraordinarily good act something. and in the next decade were going to have another billion gamers who works to really good. act whenever that it if you dont know it already this is coming the game industry is developing tonsils that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband internet so that gamers all over the world particularly

RobertGupta_2012P.stm,. and i played the first movement of the beethoven violin concerto and as i played i understood that there was a profound change occurring in the panel signs. it was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical a chemical reaction for which my plane the music. it was its catalyst and nathaniel s manic rage. was transformed into understanding a quiet curiosity and grace. and in a miracle he lifted his own violin and he started playing it by ear certain snippets of violent concertos which he then asked to complete mendelssohn tchaikovskys to the news. i was started talking about music from bach to beethoven and brahms broken of all the bees from bartok all the way up to us to put a solemn and i understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music. but he related to this music at a personal level he spoke about it with a kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angeles philharmonic. and through play music and talking about music this man had transformed. from the paranoid disturbs men that are just come from walking the streets of downtown los angeles to the charming. there your diet per million to juilliard trained musician music these medicine. music changes us and for nathaniel music is sanity because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and sheep them through his imagination and his creativity into reality. and that is can escape from instrument its to it. and i understood that this was the very essence of art this is the very reason why we made music that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core our emotions. and through our artistic learns to our creativity were able to shape as emotions into reality. and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us inspires and unites us. and for nathaniel  music brought him back into a folder friends. the redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him that recognized his talents and respected him. and i will always make music with nathaniel whether at walt disney concert hall or on skid row because he reminds me why i became a musician thank you. . . ice sheet. so after this amazingly fund conversation. you might want to say it so you still have done this ridiculous condition and go forward. an absolutely absolutely i do it stuck in the present right now but we have an amazing opportunity we can set that condition and any thing we want we can move it where we want to move it. and were going to do that where we want to move that we have to have these conversations and we have to think but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead. were going to be happy we do i know that we can and as far as im concerned. thats up in the world needs right now do. . . one day los angeles times columnist steve lopez who was walking along the streets of downtown los angeles when you heard. beautiful music and the source was a man. an african american man charming rugged homeless playing the violin that only had two strings. i m telling a story that many of you know because steves columns became the basis for a book which was turned into a movie. with robert downey jr acting as steve lopez and jamie foxx says nathaniel anthony ears the juilliard trained double bassist was promising career was cut short. by tragic affliction that paranoid schizophrenia. but daniel dropped out of juilliard he suffered a complete breakdown and thirty years later he was living homeless on the streets of skid row in downtown los angeles i encourage all of you to read steves book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond. that form between these two men but how music helps shape that bond and ultimately was instrumental if youll pardon the pun in helping the channel going off the streets. i met mr ears in two thousand eight two years ago at walt disney concert hall he had just heard a performance of beethovens first and fourth symphonies and came backstage and introduced himself was speaking in a very jovial in your carry us way about yo yo ma in the hillary clinton or how the dodgers were never going to make the world series all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of beethovens fourth symphony. and we are talking about music and i got an email from seed a few days later saying that nathaniel was interested in of while the lesson with me now i should mention that mishandle refuses treatment. because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and thorazine and handcuffs and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life. but as a result now he is prone to the states a frantic episodes the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding. and then disappearing for days wandering the streets of skid row exposed to its horrors with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him. and nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson of walt disney concert hall he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes he was lost. and he was talking about invisible demons and smoke and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep and i was afraid now for myself but i was afraid that i was to lose him that he was going to sink into one of his states. and that i would ruin his relationship with the pile then if i started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic filing pedagogy. so i just started playing,"['TED Fellows','activism','medicine']"
TomWujec_2009G.stm,. several years ago here at ted peter skillman introduced the design challenge called the marshmallow challenge and the idea is pretty simple teams of four have to build the tallest freestanding structure of a twenty six a spaghetti one yard of tape one yard of stirring and a marshmallow the marshmallow has to be on top and though it seems really simple its actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly. and so i thought this was an interesting idea and i incorporated into a design workshop and it was a huge success and since then ive. conducted about seventy design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects even the seed heroes of the fortune fifty and theres something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration and id like to share some of them with you so. normally most people begin by orienting themselves to the task they talk about it they figure out what is going to look like theyve jockey for power than they spend some time planning organizing the sketchy in the layouts to get eight as based on the majority of their time assembling the sticks into the ever growing structures and then. finally just as they are running out of time someone takes out the marshmallow and then the gingerly put it on top and they stand back. and tot. they admired their work but what really happens most of the time is that the the pub out turns into an aisle because the way to the marshmallow cause of the entire structure to buckle and to collapse so. there are a number of people who have a lot more all moments than others and among the worst our recent graduates of business school. they live at a cheap way i get distracted they then they produce really lame structures and of course theres teams that have a lot more to bow structures and among the best to our recent graduates of kindergarten. and. this here you may vague as peter tells us but not only that but do they produce the tallest structures that are the most interesting structures of them also the question you want to ask is how cup. why what is it about them and peered likes to say that none of this none of the kids spend any time trying to be ceos spaghetti inc. right they dont time spent time jockey for power but theres another reason as well and the reason is that business students are trained to find a single right plan. right and then they execute on it and what happens is when they put the marshmallow on top they run out of time and what happens its a crisis. sound familiar right ok but kindergartners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow and they build prototype success of prototypes. always keeping the marshmallow and tops of the of multiple times about two to fix it and go prototypes along the way so designers recognize this type of collaboration. as the essence of the iterative process and with each version kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesnt work. so the capacity to play and prototype this is really essential but lets look at how different teams perform. so the average for most people is around twenty inches business school students from bed to half of that lawyers will better but not much better than that can of artistic better than most adults who does the very best. architects and engineers thankfully her and. thirty nine inches the tall structure that ive seen and why is it because they understand triangles and self reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key the building itself out reinforce it was a stable structures. so as ceos little bit better than average the pews were gets interesting if you put in that executive adnan on the team they get significantly better. you know. you look around to go out that teams going away and you just tell beforehand and why said because they have special skills of facilitation they manage the process they understand the process and any team who manages and he is a close attention to to work. oddly will significantly improve the teams performance specialized skills and facilitation skills and the combination leads to to strong success. if you have ten teams that typically perform youll get maybe six or so that of standing structures match i i tried something interesting i thought whats. upped the ante once so i offer to ten thousand dollar prize of software to the winning team so what do you think happened to these design students but was the result. it s what happened. not one team had a standing structure not one had that if anyone had built say i know are wanting structure they didnt take a number of the price so isnt an interesting that high stakes that have a strong impact we did the exercise against the same students would he think happened and so now they understand the value of proto typing. so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best that produce the tallest structures and least amount of time so theres a deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success. so you might ask why would anyone actually spend time running a marshmallow and challenge and the reason is id help create digital tools and processes to help but teams build cars and video games in visual effects. and what the marshmallow challenge does that helps them identify the hidden assumptions because frankly. every project has its own marshmallow thats now but the challenge provides a shared experience a common language that common stance to build the right prototype and so this is the value of the experience of this so simple exercise and those of you who are interested may want to go to marshmallow challenge dotcom its a blog that you can look at how to build up the marshmallows air step by step instructions on this out there are. crazy examples from around the world of how people tweaking the justice system this world records that are on this as well. and the fundamental lesson i believe is that design truly is a contact sport a up it demands that they bring all of our senses to the task and that we apply the very best of our thinking or feeling and are doing to the challenge that we have at hand and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is although it takes to turn us from a an awful moment tui tai bow moment and that can make a big difference thank you very much,"['astronomy','history','innovation']"
